## Notes

Some of the challenges but were also very enjoying as an experience for me were to build everything from scratch, without the help of TypeScript (because I wanna challenge myself), using Supabase for the first time, designing the UI and UX for only more than an hour, and lastly to deliver a product that was smooth, responsive, easy to use, but also very enjoying.
